    <h1>Customer Churn Prediction</h1>
    <p>
        This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a subscription-based service or business. The goal is to identify customers at risk of cancelling their subscriptions based on their historical data, including usage behavior, demographics, and subscription details.
    </p>

  <h2>Objective</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Predict whether a customer is likely to churn or remain with the service.</li>
        <li>Develop a robust model using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting.</li>
        <li>Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>
        The dataset contains customer information such as usage behavior, demographics, and subscription details. You can download the dataset from 
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction">here</a>.
    </p>

  <h2>Approach</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical features.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Analyze and select relevant features to improve model performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Experiment with Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
        Handling imbalanced datasets and selecting the best features were significant challenges during the project. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) were used to address class imbalance.
    </p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        The final model achieved the following performance metrics:
        <ul>
            <li>Accuracy: <strong>XX%</strong></li>
            <li>Precision: <strong>XX%</strong></li>
            <li>Recall: <strong>XX%</strong></li>
            <li>F1-Score: <strong>XX%</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>How to Run</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone [repository_url]</code></li>
        <li>Install dependencies: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
        <li>Run the script: <code>python churn_prediction.py</code></li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The project successfully developed a model to predict customer churn with high accuracy and precision. This model can help businesses take proactive steps to retain customers at risk of churning.
